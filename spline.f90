subroutine cubic_spline(x_points,y_points,t,x,y,slope)
! this function returns the local slope. Input includes the "spline_points" points needed to do the 
! interpolation (the interval of interest is between the n/2 and n/2+1 points).
! t is the distance between those points in the parametric equations, and is an input as well, must be in the range [0,1]
! (i.e., t=0 is the point n/2, and t=1 is the point n/2+1). x, y, and slope are the output.
! note that the values of x_points and y_points are stored in this module so that repeat calculations of
! the spline parameters are unnecessary for the same interval.
