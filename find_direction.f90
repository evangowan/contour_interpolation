program find_direction

! This program takes one or more input polygons from two steps (could be time steps for ice sheet margins, or successive elevation contours)
! and finds the direction that they should be going. Notably, the input file will have two sets of polygons, one representing the initial step
! and the second is the second step (i.e. for an ice sheet boundary, time slice #1 and time slice #2). In order for this to work, polygons
! in a single set cannot overlap in any way, though they can overlap between the sets.

! The algorithm works in this way:
! 1) reads in all the polygons for each set
! 2) does a "point in polygon" routine for each polygon in each step. This loop will be nxm steps, where n and m are the number of polygons
!    set one and set two respectively. It has to check both ways
! 3) The direction of the vector is found by setting the vector to be towards the middle of the polygon if the set one polygon points are outside
!    the set two polygons, and towards the outside of the polygon if the set two polygon points are outside of the set one polygons



! See the run script for a quick way to generate this file from existing multi-segment files
